Mango
=====

Responsive Grid: When all you need is the freakin grid not all the styling that comes with bootstrap!

=====

Real easy to use.

1. Include either Layout.css or Layout2.css
2. Use the M-classes, Row and Container and you have yourself a responsive site!

======

Easy to read. Easy to use.

With Mango just use the M-class with a number. Make sure the total adds up to either 10 with the Layout.css file or 12 with the Layout2.css file.

Example 12 Grid:
```HTML
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="m6">
			<p>Content here.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="m6">
			<p>Content here.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
```
